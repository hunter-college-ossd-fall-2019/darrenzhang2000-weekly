# Reflections
1. This course exceeded my expectations. I came into this class expecting to learn about open source projects, 
but I've learned so much more.
Git and Linux are two useful topics that I find helpful outside of open source. 
I'm glad that I was able to contribute to the open source community in many ways, however small. 
2. One part of this course that was different than I had expected was that there isn't much coding. I expected software 
development be much more code-heavy. However, it is nice to know that there are many ways I can contribute to open source software 
development that does not involve coding (such as documentation). It also raised my awareness that even a simple bug report 
would greatly benefit an open source project.
3. Previously, I believed that documentation would be a good first contribution. I still believe that this is the case. However,
I feel that I am more capable of tackling harder contributions, such as code contributions. I hope that in a future open source 
project, I will perhaps implement a new feature or improve and existing feature through code. 
4. I wrote that I had an interest in projects involving React. I still stand by this point, as I enjoyed contributing to Open Source-NY.
I also want to try working on projects that use different languages and technologies such as Node and Express.
