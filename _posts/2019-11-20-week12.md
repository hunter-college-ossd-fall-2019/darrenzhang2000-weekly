### Reactions to [open source voting article](https://opensource.com/article/19/9/voting-fraud-open-source-solution?)
I believe that open source voting is a wonderful idea. As mentioned in class, we do not know what really goes on behind the scenes because voting is proprietary. It could be possible that votes are rigged in favor of the political party that the voting-company supports. In addition, having an open source election would reduce the probability of "faulty machinery", as in the case when a vote for Bill Waller was changed to his opponent Tate Reeves. Having open source voting would allow more people to search for bugs in the program and take those into account. Ultimately, open source voting would result in fairer elections.
